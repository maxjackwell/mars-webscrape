# mars-webscrape
The module 11 challenge is all about web scraping a web about planet Mars. In the first half of the project we are able to surf this website and grab all of the titles/previews to each of its articles. In the second half, we scraped a table and then were able to make alterations to and eventually graph in a multitiude of ways. THe method we used to grab the table was also the more difficult of the two ways to accomplisht the task. This formula can be applied to whatever website one is in the mood to scrape in the search of knowledge and discovery! In the process of completing this project, I worked alongside the AskBCS tutors, the Xpert Learing Assistant, previous classwork and these following web resources:
